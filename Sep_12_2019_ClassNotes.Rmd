# Interpretation and Transformation 

skewerness is a problem when applying regression models and in generally should be avoided.  
Transformation's goal is to reduce the skewerness

## Z-score transformation

$Z = \frac{X-\bar{X}}{\sigma_x}$  
After Z-score transformation, 1 unit of Z is measured as 1 standard deviation away form the point.
