# 1.Binary Predictor
 lm(kid.score ~ 1) is equvalent to calculating the mean of kid.score
 lm(kid.score ~ mon.hs) this automatically set the hypothesis to '1+mon.hs'. if you do not wish to include 1 in your design matrix, you have to specify 'mon.hs -1' in the argument

 for lm(kid.score ~ mon.hs), the equation will be: y = beta0 + beta1*Xhs + errors
 if Xhs = 1, y = beta0 + beta1, if Xhs = 0, y = beta0, 
 thus the intercept beta0 is just the average of kids IQ whos mon did not graduated from highschool.
 the beta1 is the difference between the mean of kid's IQ whos mon graduated from highschool vs did not graduated from highschool
 because in this case, without and with highschool are labelled 0,1. so the slope natrually became the difference of the mean between two categories

 Contrast is a way to construct predictor matrix such that the mean of one element with in the predictors will became the intercept of the model

# 2.Continuous Predictor
 lm(kid.score ~ mon.iq) -> y = beta0 + beta1*Xiq. the fitted model: beta0 = 25ish, beta1 = 0.61
 in this case, beta0 is get when Xiq = 0. but that is meaning less in the context of IQ. The intercept in this case is a over extrapolation of the data and the actual number of the intercept lose it's meaning.

 when extrapolating outside the data, you generally get a larger error. But in most applications, people avoid doing it because there is simply not enough data to support any potential claims.

 in this case, beta1 is the difference for a unit differece in mon's IQ. because the difference of 1 unit difference in IQ is way too miniscule

# 3.Binary + Continuous

 lm(kid.score ~ 1+mon.hs + mon.iq), y = beta0 + beta1*Xhs + beta2*Xiq
 beta0 = 25.73 + 0.56*Xhs + 5.95*Xiq
 In this case, beta0 means the score of kids with 0 mon.iq and no high school education

 the resulting model can be written as:
    mon with no HS: y = 25.73 + 0.56Xiq
    mon with HS:    y = 31.68 + 0.56Xiq

It is attempting to say that the model indicated that the effect of mon's highschool status has a stable effect across all the mon's IQ. However, this is actually not a result but an assumption when the Binary + Continuous model is applied to the dataset. As a statistian, you need to figure out whether this assumption holds when you are applying the model to the dataset.

# 4. Interations
 $lm(kid.score ~ 1 + mon.hs + mon.iq + mon.hs*mon.iq)$,   
 $y = beta0 + beta1*Xhs + beta2*Xiq + beta3*Xhs*Xiq$  
 
 the results are: y = -11.48 + 0.97*Xiq + 51.27*Xhs - 0.48*Xiq*Xhs
 
the model comes down to:  

no HS:    $y = -11.48 + 0.97Xiq$  
with HS:  $y = -11.48 + 0.48Xiq$  

This model assumes that mother's HS status will affect how the scale of mother's IQ effect on kid's IQ. So before interpret anything from the results, this assumption needs to be examed
